# Advent of Code 2023

This repository holds my input files and solutions for [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023).
I will be attempting a solution in Rust for each day. Scala is my backup; I haven't yet decided if I will also write a Scala solution each day.

## Rust

The `rust` subfolder contains the Rust solutions (run via Cargo). For example, to run the solution for day 1:

```shell
cargo run -- 1
```

## Scala

The `scala` subfolder contains the Scala solutions. Each `.sc` file is directly executable on *nix if you have scala-cli installed.
To run the solution for day 1:

```shell
./day1.sc
```
